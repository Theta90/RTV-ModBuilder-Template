## Setup

Install the RTV-ModBuilder as a dev dependency via:

```sh

npm i -D "github:Theta90/RTV-ModBuilder#main"

```

## How It Works

This script (index.js) serves as the build entry point for the mod. Running it (e.g., via F5
or `node index.js`) will invoke the RTV-ModBuilder and produce the final mod output
in the configured output directory.

## Configuration

The index.js file must be tailored to each specific project. The following options should
be adjusted per project:

- **`projectRoot`** — The root directory of the mod, relative to this file.
  This is where the builder will look for files to include in the mod.
  It can be the same as the project root, or a subdirectory if you want to
  keep your source files separate from other project files.

- **`outDir`** — The directory where the built mod will be output (e.g., `"build"`).
  If the projectRoot is in a subdirectory, this will output in a subdir of that.
- **`packageInfo`** — Suggested to use the values from `package.json`:
  - `id` — The package `name` field, used as the mod's unique identifier.
  - `name` — The package `displayName` field, used as the human-readable mod name.
  - `version` — The package `version` field.

- **`globs`** — A list of glob patterns describing which source files to include.
  Each entry accepts an `options` object supporting `ignore` patterns and a `cwd`
  (working directory) to resolve files from. Adjust these to match your project's
  source structure. For more details, see [text](https://www.archiverjs.com/).

- **`modTxtOptions`** — Configuration for generating the mod's `mod.txt` file:
  - `autoload` — A map of autoload names to their corresponding script paths.
  - `author` — A custom field that can be populated if desired (probably want to!)
  - `modworkshopID` — An optional numeric ID for the mod, used for RTV's mod workshop.
  - `priority` — Determines the load order of mods.

- **`options`** — Additional builder options:
  - `includeVersionInName` — Whether to append the version number to the output
    mod's name.
  - `verbose` — Whether to enable verbose logging during the build.

## Example Output Structure

This example's HelloWorld.vmz has the following structure:

```
HelloWorld.vmz
├── mod.txt
├── mods
│   └── HelloWorld
│       └── Main.gd
│       └── README.md
│       └── Scripts
│           └── Character.gd

```
